This is a React application!

As stated in the instructions given for this 24-hour take home prompt, it mentions to NOT include the node_modules folder.
To run the application, this folder is needed. 

To run the application is as follows:

Step 1: Unzip the folder once downloaded

Step 2: Open the terminal and go to the directory dropdown-app, for ex: C:\Users\elias\Desktop\hive_ai\dropdown-app>

Step 3: Once you are inside the directory, in your terminal run the command : npm install

This will download the node_modules folder that is needed to run the application.

Step 4: After the node_modules folder is downloaded from the previous step, you are ready to run the project. 
To do so in the terminal run the command: npm start 
The browser should pop up and load the application on localhost:3000. If not, input: localhost:3000 on any browser.

Step 5: Enjoy the drop down menus!
